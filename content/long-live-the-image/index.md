The installation LONG LIVE THE IMAGE! was presented at the group exhibition <a href="http://www.strictlyrabbit.be/curated-project/de-lading-2011/" target="_blank">De Lading</a> 
as a part of a body of works entitled <em>Il était l’image vivante</em>. 
Underlying concepts are the pictorial connotations of life,
the idea of an archeology of cinema and the historicity and historiality of the moving image.
These resonate with our experience of film and images and speak of the place of images
in our media societies. The notion of living of both film and photography reaches further
than merely denoting something apparently alive. LONG LIVE THE IMAGE! takes its share in attempting to evoke
the play of these concepts.

The installation <em>Monotgari</em> continues the reflection on the historical role of the image in western societies. 
Here this role of the image is presented through the remake of a shot of the film <em>Tokyo Monogatari</em> (Tokyo Story&ndash;1953). 
The original scene wherein the shot appeared is one of Ozu's most concise “summaries” of his subject matter: 
the generational conflict and the societal changes of the 20<sup>th</sup> century in Japan.

Through the cut out 4:3 frame in the pile of paper the sequence runs in a loop.

Lecture at the CASYS ’11, 10th International Conference on Computing Anticipatory Systems, Liège, August 9<sup>th</sup>, 2011. Abstract:  

<br>
Objective constitution asks for subjective time experience. Drawing this central proposition from contemporary 
film studies and Andrey Tarkovsky’s writings on film, the lecture will juxtapose this idea with the Kantian concepts of 
time and unity of apperception&mdash;albeit the important difference of level of discourse. 
The advanced conception is indeed crucial in the understanding of the genesis of meaning: 
through the peculiar kind of experiences of the ‘moving image’ the lecture attempts to recast the problem. 
However, this will confront several difficulties in different disciplines, from the enduring Kantian starting point 
of constraining metaphysics, to the development of anticipative systems and, prominently, the problem of time in epistemology.

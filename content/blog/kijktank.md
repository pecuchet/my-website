KIJKTANK is a think tank studying the socially critical relevance of self-referential or self-reflective filmmaking within the global culture of the image.
<br/>
The moving image occupies a central position in our contemporary global societies. KIJKTANK therefore schedules and analyses self-referential films, that is, films that take a critical stance towards their language as the language of our culture of the image. In this KIJKTANK cultivates a socially critical attitude.

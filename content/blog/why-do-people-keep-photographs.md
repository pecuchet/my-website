<br>
*Why do people keep photographs?* is a project by <a href="http://www.tessagroenewoud.nl/" target="_blank">Tessa groenewoud</a>.
Every day a video is automatically generated based on a passage from the crime novel ‘Mrs. McGinty’s Dead’ (1952) by Agatha Christie. 
Each word from the fragment is used to select the day’s highest ranking image result in the image search engines of Bing, Google or Yahoo. 
  
<br>
The first version of the project uses PHP and Javascript. We are however developing on a second version in Python. 
Working solely on the server yields the ability to generate a video file and to perform image analysis
on each requested image.
